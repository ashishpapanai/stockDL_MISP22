## Efficient Prediction of Annual Yield from Stocks Using Hybrid Deep Learning
**Author:** Ashish Papanai
### Abstract
Predicting and analyzing the stock market has been of primary interest to re-searchers, investors, and market experts. The technology has been evolving continuously from manual to automated collection, tuning, and data analy-sis to generate insights and predict the rise or fall of a stock. This work pre-sents stockDL, a deep learning solution to analyze, understand the historical stock data and calculate the gross and annual yield for the chosen stock tick-er. The proposed solution is comprehensive and user-friendly. It includes da-ta collection and preprocessing and utilizes various mathematical and deep learning techniques for feature extraction combined with state-of-art neural network architectures to predict the market trends. The stockDL algorithm assimilates two traditional stock trading techniques, Buy and Hold strategy and Moving Average ribbon trading strategy, with two Deep Learning Mod-els created using the state-of-art Long Short-Term Memory networks. The first model is a pure LSTM network, whereas the second network is a Mix-ture of Convolution Neural networks and LSTMs. stockDL uses the data of the past five years from the date of generating the predictions, making the model immune from any sudden fluctuations in the historical data. When evaluated on the four stock symbols (AAPL, GOOGL, HDFCBANK.NSE, RELIANCE.NSE), the model has attained state-of-art for deep learning backed algorithmic trading in a controlled computational environment. The novel solution introduced in this study is faster and more accurate than any existing deep-learning solutions available. It is immune from any sudden dramatic decline among significant sections of the stock market. This work contributes to the stock analysis and research community of technical and financial domains.
